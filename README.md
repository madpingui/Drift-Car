# Drift Car
Drift Car is a project that was born thanks to the fun that drifting gave me in video games, simply look for several ways to apply Drift in Unity and gather several assets that I will mention below to make my own drifting place, it is a single mechanic but it's fun to play with it.

Assets:<br />
[STYLIZED: Free Drift Car](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/stylized-free-drift-car-197718)<br />
[Race Tracks](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/race-tracks-140501)<br />
